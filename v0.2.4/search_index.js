The purpose of the package is to: (1) provide differentiable programming framework for scientific computing based on TensorFlow automatic differentiation (AD) backend; (2) adapt syntax to facilitate implementing scientific computing, particularly for numerical PDE discretization schemes; (3) supply missing functionalities in the backend (TensorFlow) that are important for engineering, such as sparse linear algebra, constrained optimization, etc. Applications include","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"ADCME Documentation","title":"ADCME Documentation","text":"full wavelength inversion\nreduced order modeling in solid mechanics\nlearning hidden geophysical dynamics\nphysics based machine learning\nparameter estimation in stochastic processes","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"ADCME Documentation","title":"ADCME Documentation","text":"The package inherents the scalability and efficiency from the well-optimized backend TensorFlow. Meanwhile, it provides access to incooperate existing C/C++ codes via the custom operators. For example, some functionalities for sparse matrices are implemented in this way and serve as extendable \"plugins\" for ADCME.
